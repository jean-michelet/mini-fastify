# ðŸ§  mini-fastify (WIP)

A work-in-progress educational reimplementation of Fastify's core concepts.

The goal is to:

- Demystify the internal architecture of Fastify
- Introduce key libraries like `avvio` and `find-my-way`
- Explore computer science and Node.js/JavaScript advanced concepts.

This is not a production-ready web framework, but a learning tool designed for experienced developers and potential contributors who want to understand how things really work under the hood.
